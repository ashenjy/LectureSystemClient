The “Lecture Capturing System” is a cloud-based web application which uses enhanced techniques to provide an interactive e-learning experience to users of the system. It uses a facial recognition-based authentication process to allow remote users to login to the system. A Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) IP camera captures and tracks the lecturer during the lecture session and this is streamed live to remotely logged-in students. The lecturer can also share the computer screen if required. The camera intelligently identifies specific gestures performed by the lecturer to rotate with the aid of gesture analyzing algorithms. Attendance of remote online students is marked automatically during a live-streaming lecture by using multiple facial recognition processes executing on the server. Offline recording of lectures is also supported after which the video is split into a series of chapters/thumbnails and the audio is converted to text; each chapter representing a presentation slide and the relevant text. Bandwidth and quota are managed intelligently to ensure the best possible transmission rate with minimum data consumption in order to avoid filling the link to capacity which would result in network congestion and poor performance of the network. This system is revolutionary and is capable of taking e-learning to the next level as it provides a complete classroom experience and much more to the remote users. It also has the ability to support multiple enterprise customers.
